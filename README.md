# **Zoovu NPM packages**


### **Overview**

Every 4.x runner design uses NPM packages which make bootstrapping the project as easy as it possible and helps with maintaining versioning of the runner logic part. There are 3 existing private packages, which are using **@zoovu** domain.

**Packages names: **



1. runner-browser-api
2. runner-browser-test-utils
3. runner-web-design-base


---


### **Zoovu packages usage**


```
There is no need to register the other packages. Since they are used as dependencies for runner-web-design-base they are downloaded to the node_modules' @zoovu domain directory as well.
```


Every theme requires a **runner-web-design-base **package to be installed. It must be registered as theme/ design dependency in the package.json file. Which version should be integrated would have to be checked on some up to date theme.


```
"dependencies": {
    "@zoovu/design-system": "^4.21.1",
    "@zoovu/runner-browser-api": "~4.28.0",
    "@zoovu/runner-browser-test-utils": "~4.28.0",
    "@zoovu/runner-web-design-base": "~4.30.0"
},
```



## **Running 4.x themes/ designs**

Once you input desired assistant code to .env file, you should run:


```
yarn serve
```


This will create a full local build of the project and open a local preview in the browser's window.

**Deployment**

In order to deploy you custom design, you need to run:


```
yarn build
```


This will create a production package of the project. All of following files must be uploaded to a server and linked to the assistant on Zoovu platform:
